Negative Risk Annotation Plugin for Chrome
==========================================

This Chrome extension adds an annotation to linked markets on PredictIt to tell you if they are a good candidate for negative risk purchasing.  NOTE: by default, this extension ignores individual trades selling for more than 97¬¢.  To change this, see the "Options" in the extension.

Usage
=====

Browse to any linked Market page on PredictIt.  You will see one of three markers appear next to the "refresh" button:

* ‚ùì = Too few markets to calculate negative risk.
* ‚ùå = Bad Bet (there is no potential to make money by buying all shares)
* üòê = Mixed Bet (it is possible to gain or lose money depending on the outcome)
* ‚úÖ = Good Bet (no matter the outcome, you should make money)
* ü§ë = Great Bet (based on a configurable threshold)

Hover your mouse over the icon to see the potential gain or loss.

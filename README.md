Negative Risk Annotation Plugin for Chrome
==========================================

This Chrome extension adds an annotation to linked markets on PredictIt to tell you if they are a good candidate for negative risk purchasing.  NOTE: this extension ignores individual trades selling for more than 97¬¢, so factor that into your purchases.
